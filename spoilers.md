# SPOILERS

Below are my notes for the narrative, mechanics for the game. If you don't mind the surprise being spoiled for you, you are welcome to proceed. If not, do not proceed further.

# Characters

1. Freddie is our protagonist. He is a reformed bandit, previously known as "Killjoy", who left behind the life of a bandit when he realized he was outmatched. As it happened, the bandits were ransoming a wealthy man's daughter, and he returned her safely to her family. As a reward, the wealthy man granted Freddie a prime homestead after a season's training (i.e. the tutorial) for which the townsfolk resent him. The name "Freddie" means "Joyful", which is an allusion to the name Gaius. As in Gaius Marius the ancient Roman general.

1. Felix is our primary antagonist in town. He is a lifelong townsman who has worked for everything he has, and perceives Freddie as taking credit for his defense of the homstead in the tutorial. This is an allusion to Cornelius Sulla "Felix", the rival general in Rome to Gaius Marius. Felix becomes suspicious of Freddie during the attack when he seems to know what the bandits are going to do before they do it.

1. Quinton is the patriarch of the wealthy family who is training Freddie and Felix as homesteaders to run farms that are vacated by farmers who could not maintain their homesteads. This is a reference to Quintus Lutatius Catulus, who was Gaius Marius' mentor.

1. Buzzard is Freddie's antagonist as the bandit "Killjoy". Buzzard and Killjoy have a blood fued that goes back many generations, its origins lost to the fog of history. What they do remember is the years of rivalry, theft, and one upmanship. Finally, Buzzard put Killjoy in a corner with no escape without a drastic solution. This precipitated the return of the hostage back to the wealthy family.
